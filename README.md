I made this repo because I had troubles with X2JS in a webpack/angularjs/Meteor based application.
If you also face this kind of issues using [angular-x2js (seems no more maintained)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-x2js):

```
ReferenceError: X2JS is not defined
```

**The solution is to replace the dependency on `angular-x2js` by `angular-x2js-wrapper` in your `package.json` file.**

And update Angular dependency injection accordingly:
```javascript
angular.module('your_module_name', ['fmd.x2js'])
```

Actually `angular-x2js` works only if `X2JS` variable is defined directly in `window`.

On the other hand, `angular-x2js-wrapper` doesn't require you to manually handle external dependencies, it's working out of the box. Enjoy it! ðŸŽ‰
